## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am a big gamer, and I wanted to create something to make the process
of finding new players to join a clan, milsim (Military Simulator) much easier.
The old way of finding such people is to either ask your current friends or directly message people you
meet in the game you wish to play. This can be a tedious process. My idea is to create a forum where people can make "looking for group"
posts to attract the attention of other users. These posts can then be searched for by game/genre/ or looking for clan/milsim/friends.
The idea of including a direct messaging system could also be used to get in touch with the creator of a particular post.
